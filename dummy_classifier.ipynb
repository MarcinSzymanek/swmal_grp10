    "\n",
    "There is a `sklearn.datasets.fetch_openml` dataloader interface in Scikit-learn. You can load MNIST data like \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml\n",
    "# Load data from https://www.openml.org/d/554\n",
    "X, y = fetch_openml('mnist_784',??) # needs to return X, y, replace '??' with suitable parameters! \n",
    "# Convert to [0;1] via scaling (not always needed)\n",
    "#X = X / 255.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "but you need to set parameters like `return_X_y` and `cache` if the default values are not suitable! \n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the documentation for the `fetch_openml` MNIST loader, try it out by loading a (X,y) MNIST data set, and plot a single digit via the `MNIST_PlotDigit` function here (input data is a 28x28 NMIST subimage)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%matplotlib inline\n",
    "def MNIST_PlotDigit(data):\n",
    "    import matplotlib\n",
    "    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "    image = data.reshape(28, 28)\n",
    "    plt.imshow(image, cmap = matplotlib.cm.binary, interpolation=\"nearest\")\n",
    "    plt.axis(\"off\")\n",
